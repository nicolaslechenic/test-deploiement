when registering, even if its saying error, it keeps the registration in cache and when it finally works, it sends all of the inputs when it wasnt working before // seems like its fixed

registration sending 4 times ?????????? maybe cuz of index.php sending to the controller 4 times. // done

when form is filled entirely but something isnt right it still puts you to the success page BUT throws the error.

contactform not working anymore // done
